# Fibonacci numbers

This file introduces the Fibonacci sequence.

## Implementations notes

We use the definition from Mathlib.

## Main results

- Initial values.
- `sum_range_fib_eq_fib`: compute the partial sums of the sequence.
- `two_mul_fib_n`, `three_mul_fib_n`, `four_mul_fib_n`: identities for
  calculating `i * Fibonacci n`.
