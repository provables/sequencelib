# Powers of Primes

This file introduces the powers of primes integer sequence, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, ...
This is sequence [A000961](https://oeis.org/A000961), a core sequence in the OEIS.

## Implementation notes

The sequence is defined using the `IsPrimePow` predicate from Mathlib.

## Main results

- The basic definition and the first values of the sequence are given, up to `n=6`.
