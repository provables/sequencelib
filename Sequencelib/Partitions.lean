# Partitions

This file introduces the Partitions sequence, a core sequence on the OEIS.

## Implementation notes

The sequence is defined as the cardinality of `Nat.Partition` structure from Mathlib.

## Main results

- The basic definition and the first two values of the sequence are given.

namespace Sequence

/--
The sequence of the number of partitions of `n`; i.e., 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...
