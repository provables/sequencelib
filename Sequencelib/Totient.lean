# Totient sequence

The sequence corresponding to the Euler totient function, `phi(n)`; This function counts the
number of numbers less than `n` and coprime with `n`; i.e., 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 2, 6, ...

## Implementation notes

The sequence is defined using the `Nat.totient` function from Mathlib.

## Main results

- The basic definition and the first values of the sequence are given, up to `n=10`.
