# Sequencelib

A platform for formalizing sequences from 
[The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS)](https://oeis.org).

The [main site](https://provables.github.io/sequencelib) contains an
automatically generated index of the sequences formalized in this repository.
You can also find more detailed instructions for developing, building, and contributing.

## Quickstart

This project is a standard [Lake](https://lean-lang.org/documentation/setup/) project, so a running 
Lean installation is enough for building and 
[contributing](https://provables.github.io/sequencelib/contributing.html). If you are able to
use Lean from VSCode, you are ready to use this project by cloning it and opening the root folder 
in the editor.

### Alternative Setup

Alternatively, we also packed a full Lean installation together with the tools needed for 
building, linting, indexing, and generating the website, in a [Nix](https://nixos.org/) environment.
It is usable in MacOS and Linux.

All that is needed is a [Nix installation](https://nixos.org/download/). Once `nix` is available,
run the environment with

```shell
nix develop
```

We provide a task runner that can run the most common utilities. Run `task -a` to see all the tasks
available. Some examples are:

* `task build`: builds the project and checks the theorems.
* `task lint`: run the linters.
* `task serve-page`: build the site, index, and docs, and serve it locally.

Most of the tasks are simple invocations of `lake`, but the task manager is useful to ensure all
the dependent tasks run in order and to skip over unnecessary work.
